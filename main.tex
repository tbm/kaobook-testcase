\setchapterimage[9.5cm]{images/spreadsheet}
\chapter{Just a test}

Note how the top of the image is cut off.

\setchapterimage[10.5cm]{images/spreadsheet}
\chapter{Just a test}

Changing the paramter from 9.5cm to 10.5cm makes no difference

\setchapterimage[10.5cm]{images/spreadsheet-wider}
\chapter{Just a test}

Using a wider image (maybe I got the aspect ratio wrong) doesn't help.

\setchapterimage[10.5cm]{images/spreadsheet-high}
\chapter{Just a test}

Using a higher image (maybe I got the aspect ratio wrong) doesn't help.
